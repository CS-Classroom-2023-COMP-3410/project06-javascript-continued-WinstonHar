This was my prompt:
Now using the UI element in the bottom path tree visualization convert the shown up selected box to be a button taking back to where you selected that path

Previously I added a box at the bottem of the story text that appened to a list what selections you made in the story before. So to add more functionality I wanted to make those appended items buttons, so that a user could back track in the story by clicking on previous choices they already made. 
ChatGPT managed to create that functionality but in doing so broke the rest of the code, in terms if the player progression system. What I mean is at the top of the webpage there is a progress bar. Previous to adding the buttons to the list of previous choices the progress bar worked perfectly fine. So afterwards the progress bar broke and stayed at 0% not matter what I did. Additionally the list of button did not remove the later choices you seleced after you backtracked, making it impossible to create a new path as the choices would just be appended to the end, instead of after the current choice you just made (if that makes any sense). 
I believe the reason chatGPT was unable to fix the code and make the feature work with my existing code was due to the limited amount of text chatGPT 4.0 could look at at once. So it was not able to read all 350 lines of the JS code at once to identify the source of the problem. I believe when I tried to trouble shoot it by hand it was due to the new code for the button function changing how items where appened to a list that controlled what scenes were selected. The conversation file includes me trying to get chatgpt to fix the code after it implemented some features successfully.
